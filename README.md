# Scalable Fairlearn


# TODOs

### Complete Hybrid Method
* Single hybrid method that gets the best of all hybrid methods we have
* Show that it works on both train and test data

### Scaling experiments
* Show running time savings when dataset is very large (use synthetic data)
* Also try logistic regression on large image dataset

### Multiple datasets
* Show it works on three datasets
* Try logistic regression on large image dataset

### Increasing number of attributes
* Decide if we can do that experiment...

### Other things
* How to subsample for the scalability plot to ensure + and - points are treated equally (stratified data sampling?)

# Scalable Fairlearn

### TODOs:
1. No increasing attributes experiment? Decide if we can do that experiment...
2. How to subsample for the scalability plot to ensure + and - points are treated equally (stratified data sampling?)
3. <span style="color:red">Logistic reg on image dataset</span>
4. Testing on test set? See what paper did
5. Take best hybrid on train set to obtain 1 single Hybrid method? 
   Use a user-defined combination parameter in [0-1] of violation vs error.
